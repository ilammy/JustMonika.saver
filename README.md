# ❤️ JustMonika.saver

_A little bit of Monika in my life_

## 📦 Installation

### macOS

1. ~~Download the screen saver here~~ (oh, that’s not possible now, so build it yourself)
2. Close _System Preferences_ window if you have it open.
3. Open **JustMonika.saver** by right-clicking it and selecting _Open_ in the dropdown menu.
4. “_JustMonika.saver_ can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer” appears. This is [Gatekeeper security feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) which activates because the screen saver has not been notarized by Apple.
5. Press _Open_ in the dialog box to install the screen saver.

## 🛠 Building

### macOS

2. `open JustMonika.xcworkspace`
3. Build **JustMonika** target.
